## q1

### b.

- @Override was used above toString() as it overrides a method in the base Object class.
- This is useful because it will cause a compile time error if the overriden method header is not correct.
- It is also useful because other developers can identify that it is intended to be an overridden method (changes will
  also lead to compile time errors.)

### c.

#### i.

- 1, 2, 3

#### ii.

- none

#### iii.

- 1, 2, 3

#### iv.

- none

#### v.

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

#### vi.

- 1, 2, 3

#### vii.

- none

#### viii.

- none

### d.

| Class: |     Player      |
|:------:|:---------------:|
| name:  | "Joseph Bloggs" |
| goals: |        0        |

### e.

- actual arguments, or actual parameters, often just arguments, are the values passed into a method or constructor.
- such as the following declaring an instance of Player: `Player p1 = new Player("Actual Parameter")`
- formal arguments, or formal parameters, often just parameters, are the declared variables within the header of a method or constructor that will be assigned when the method is invoked.
- such as the aName in the setName method `public void setName(String aName)`

### f.

- A call to super is incorrectly made in the constructor, but the class does not inherit from (*extend*) another class so it is superfluous.
- remove super call from constructor.
