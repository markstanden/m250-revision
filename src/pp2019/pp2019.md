#### ii.

- minPayRate is a class variable and is created when the application is first run, not at instance creation.
- class (static) variables, therefore, do not need an instance to be created at all.

#### iii.

- `aPayRate`, the formal parameter declared within the `setPayRate` method is, as with all formal parameters, scoped
  only to the method it is declared within.
- It cannot be accessed outside the block of code is declared within, which is the method itself.
- The instance variable `payrate` declared within the class as `private double payRate` is scoped within an instance of
  the class, and is only available to methods within the class.
